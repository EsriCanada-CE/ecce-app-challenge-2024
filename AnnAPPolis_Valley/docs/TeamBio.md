I graduated from Dalhousie University in 2023 with a BSc Combined Honours in Earth Sciences and Physics. Some of my favourite courses were related to GIS and programming so I decided to pursue a graduate certificate in Geospatial Data Analytics at COGS. Outside of school I enjoy playing music, photography, hiking, and camping.

Originally from CÃ´te d'Ivoire, West Africa, I'm enhancing my GIS skills at COGS, building on my Master's in GIS and Remote Sensing and a Bachelor's degree in Earth Sciences. My passion for GIS and programming drives me to apply spatial analysis in addressing real-world challenges. I am fluent in multiple languages, adeptly navigating diverse settings, aiming to leverage GIS capabilities in a variety of projects. My hobbies, which include video games, reading, and soccer, keep me grounded and connected globally.

I am a student at NSCC COGS for the GIS Graduate Certificate program and I have a BA in Geography from McGill University. I took a few Computer Science, GIS, and Remote Sensing courses during my time at McGill and decided to pursue a GIS program at COGS to advance my technical skills and employability in the industry. So far I have enjoyed my time here at COGS, it was a definitely a unique opportunity to get away from the city life and I learned a lot from the courses I took. My hobbies include dragonboating and learning Cantonese!
