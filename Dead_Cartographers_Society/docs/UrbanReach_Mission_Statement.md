As urban expansion continues to boom in Canada, concerns are being raised at all levels of government regarding the issue of transportation and accessibility. If the increase of urban spread precedes the implementation of proper transit infrastructure, not only are the accessibility needs of many citizens neglected, but environmental concerns, such as a car-dependent culture, begin to rise. In response to this, on July 23, 2023, the Government of Canada committed to investing $14.9 billion over the following eight years into transit options that are reliable, fast, affordable and clean to match the growing needs of an expanding urban landscape. This funding is still primarily dedicated to catching up. To combat persistent accessibility inequities in high-growth regions, transit and bike access must be built alongside new developments. Rather than an afterthought, they must be treated like road access or sewer connectivity as a compulsory part of the planning process

The mission of DCS is to evaluate accessibility to public transit and safe biking trails within areas of rapid urban expansion. Our app, Urban Reach, focuses on three regional districts identified by the province of BC as “high-growth regions”, as listed below:

* Central Okanagan Regional District (Kelowna)
* Greater Vancouver Regional District
* Capitol Regional District (Victoria)

Alongside the data, the transportation growth plan for each region is considered to evaluate the strategies being implemented to meet the accessibility needs of urban growth.

Although the focus of this app is on high-growth regions in BC, the same results are replicable nationwide and could be adapted to highlight other measures of transportation accessibility like footpaths or differentiate between bus and rail access in suburban centers.
