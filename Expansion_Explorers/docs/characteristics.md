# Community Garden Site Finder

The Community Garden Site Finder helps citizens find potential locations for new community garden projects. It also helps to connect citizens to existing resources. 

## Map Explorer View 
Aside from finding a group of interested people and determining a budget, finding a location is one of the most important steps in beginning a community garden. Deciding on a location can be influenced by many factors including surrounding transportation options,  zoning regulations, and accessibility to for all community members.  

The Map Explorer View displays a map of Edmonton, AB containing parks that may make potential sites for community gardens. Also included in the Map Explorer View is information on zoning and a series of point features. Zooming into an area of interest, the Potential Site list updates to the current extent. Additional map layers also become visible. 

The user then selects a potential site of interest from the list. From this, a 0.5km (or user defined) buffer is created around the potential site. The user can then view features found within this buffer that may influence their decision on choosing this site location, such as nearby bus stops. In this view, users can toggle off and on layers to discover more about the area surrounding their potential sites.

## Site Details View
In the Site Details View, the user is introduced to more details about the potential site that they have chosen. They can view the park type, as well as the address. This view also gives the user greater detail of the applicable zoning in their area of interest, and directs them to where they can find additional details. The user can also find directions to the location using the Direction Tool.

## Reports Page
In the report page, users can find more details about the different layers around their potential area. They also have the option to print off a report with useful information.

## Current Community Gardens Page

This map contains current community gardens in the city and provides useful details about them. The user can use this page if they are interested in potentially joining an existing garden. Groups or individuals starting out their own project would also benefit from being able to contact and gain wisdom from groups already running similar projects.
