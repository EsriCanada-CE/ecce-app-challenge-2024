# Community Garden Site Finder
## Mission Statement

As cities expand and prices increase, people are looking for ways to help cut down on costs while still contributing to their local communities and thus urban agriculture is becoming more popular. Providing spaces and opportunities for citizens to practice urban gardening regardless of their living situation helps to makes cities more livable and community-oriented. 

Our app, Community Garden Site Finder, aims to help citizens search for suitable locations for potential new community gardens around the Edmonton, Alberta area. The app also provides information and some references that can be used to help get a garden started.
