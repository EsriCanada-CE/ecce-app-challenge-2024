### Mission Statement
There is a negative relationship between food security and urbanization. As people migrate to cities, and the city footprints grow, there are fewer farmers, and less land to put farms on (Kang et al., 2023). The City of Halifax states that the average distance that food travels to get to Nova Scotia is 4,000km (Halifax, 2024). In a post 2020 world, we are very aware of the dangers of relying on remote food supply chains. In addition, as of 2022, 1 in 4 people in Halifax were food insecure (Feed Nova Scotia, 2023). This increase in food insecurity is not unique to this one city. Canada wide, the number of people who don’t have enough food day to day is growing (Statistics Canada, 2023). As grocery prices continue to rise, there is no sign of relief to come.  

BoroughGreen, which is based in the city of Halifax and part of the Halifax Regional Municipality, aims to help users determine how suitable their land is for growing food, and to give recommendations on what type of garden to set up and what to grow. It also gives locations of community gardens and fruit trees located across the city. Through this app, we want to show that there are still ways to garden in a city, even if you don’t have the space or proper soil. Our goal for BouroughGreen is to help address food insecurity in Halifax by connecting people with local food resources and empowering them to grow food in their own backyards, on their porches, and in community gardens.  

### App Characteristics
BoroughGreen is an interactive, easy to use app which connects people to resources which allow them to explore food possibilities in their city! Starting your own garden can be daunting, and good resources for a beginner gardener can be hard to find. It can be difficult to know where to start! We want to simplify the food growing and harvesting process for our app users and show them that everyone has a bit of a green thumb. 

When planning what to plant in your garden, it’s important to think local! Certain plants grow well in warmer climates, and others need cooler climates. When a beginner gardener searches for information on google, they will be presented with plant growing information from around the world, which might not be suitable for Halifax. Our app gives all the information you need to plant a garden in our city and is tailored to this region. 

Many people who would benefit from growing their own food live in apartments or other places without land that is suitable for gardening. Halifax is home to an impressive number of community gardens, which allow people to pay a modest fee for a garden plot and grow their own food. Our app allows users to find a community garden near them and gives them access to the resources they need to successfully grow their own fruit and vegetables! 

In addition to providing important information to urban gardeners, BoroughGreen shows all the edible fruit and nut trees in the city, which allows app users to harvest their own food! Apple picking is a popular activity in the fall, wouldn’t it be fun to apple pick for free in your neighborhood? With BoroughGreen, you can! 

### How to Use the App
The BouroughGreen app is an easy to use platform composed of two apps and a tips page. These three resources together make up a powerful resource for urban food growing.
When you open the BouroughGreen app, you will be presented with a popup welcoming you to the app and restating our mission statement. When you click away from the popup, it disappears, and you can start exploring!

**Land suitability:**

The first app available for exploration shows the suitability of properties in the Halifax regional municipality for gardening. You can go to your current location in the municipality easily, simply by clicking on the small target icon at the top left of the map, above the compass. You can also find your property of interest using the search bar indicated by the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen. Type in the address of your location of interest, and away you go! 
You can explore the map in another way by simply zooming in and out and panning by clicking and dragging (or touching and dragging on your phone’s touchscreen). Once you arrive at your property of interest, click on the polygon over it to get information on how suitable the land is for growing food. Is your house in a layer that has a low suitability ranking? No sweat! There is more than one way to grow a garden. The description of your polygon will let you know what type of garden is right for your area. This map also includes layers with information about the soil, slope, aspect, etc. for the HRM study area. Get curious and enjoy toggling through these layers using the widget on the right side of your screen. This will give you information on how your suitability was scored and will help you to understand what plants would be perfect for you and your garden.

**Community page:**

The CommunityFresh app opens with points showing where all the community gardens, fruit, and nut trees are within the HRM. Look in the top right corner of the screen to see more information on the app. In the bottom right corner, there is a widget that shows the many fruit and nut trees you have to choose from. As with the Good2Grow app, you can zoom to your current location using the target icon on the left side of your screen, or find a property by typing an address into the search bar symbolized by a magnifying glass on the top right side of the map frame. Another cool feature of this app can be seen at the bottom of the screen. When you zoom in to a location and click “update results”, you get to see just the fruit and nut trees and community gardens that are near to you. Click on the arrow to the right of the community gardens tab, or the public fruit trees tab to expand out the nearby options. There is always so much to learn about the natural world! We recommend taking our app on an adventure with you as you walk through the city and using it to identify trees near you. You can even get the kids involved! 

**Tips page:**

Are you interested in fresh, local food, but aren’t sure where to start when it comes to planting a garden? Check out our tips page!
