## Mission Statement
The city of Toronto is quintessential to urban expansion. As the most populous city in Canada, roughly three million people call it home. Road2Home is an app that was created in response to the issue of urban expansion and its accompanying demand. Our goal is to support aspiring Toronto residents to make thoughtful decisions on which neighbourhood to move to based on their needs and preferences.

Suburbs have been developed surrounding the city’s downtown core but these neighbourhoods haven’t evolved in the same way. Toronto’s 158 neighbourhoods differ in many aspects, such as the prevalence of green spaces, access to transportation, walkability, crime rates, and population demographics. These are just a few variables found in open datasets across the web, which we have compiled into an interactive one-stop shop to identify which area of Toronto would be the most suitable place to live based on your personal preferences. 

Perhaps you wish to live in a bustling area with high population density and easy access to cafes and restaurants, or maybe you’re a young family looking for a quiet neighbourhood near schools. Every individual faces a unique situation and ideals, and there is no single perfect location for everyone. Our interactive app allows you to make the choice yourself based on your top three priorities. If you already have prospective areas in mind, we offer an alternative view window for a comparative analysis with even more neighbourhood characteristics available to visualize.

## App Features
There is no one perfect neighbourhood for everyone – utilizing this app can help you choose the best neighbourhood in Toronto for you based on your unique preferences.
This is done through multiple access points on the main page including the menu that takes you to the map page in question. Users can either use the app to choose a suitable neighbourhood to live in from a chosen set of wishlist items or assess the suitability of a neighbourhood that they already have in mind.
This is meant to be an ever-growing app. Users who find they are missing important features in their decision-making progress can submit the Survey 123 questionnaire at the bottom of the Choices page which displays the math and organization behind the variables found in the tool itself. 

## Getting started

1.	Upon arriving on the home page, take a minute to scroll down to either get a quick preview of the variables available to filter by, or watch the short video explaining the app as well as providing a quick rundown on how to use the map tool. 
2.	If desired, click through to the Your Choice page on the menu to learn more about the categories themselves and how the data is organized.
3.	To use the map tool you have two options:

    a.	A simpler, toggle system that allows you to quickly display neighbourhoods that match all of your criteria. These are displayed on the left of the screen. Click on them to learn specifics about the Neighborhood in question. 

    b.	A more in-depth system that allows you to slide the previous view to the side and look at each of the datasets in relation to each other. Choose your layers at the top left of the screen above where the data about neighbourhoods sits.
