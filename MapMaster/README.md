## Mission Statement	
The 2021 census showed that Toronto, Ontario has a population of 2.7 million, occupying 7.6% of total Canadian population (City of Toronto, 2022). By 2030, the population is forecasted to increase to 3.5 million people by 2030 (Muller, 2023). With an expanding population comes an expanding city with more buildings, roads and infrastructure.  With the expansion of the city, comes more difficulties for individuals to be sustainable and connect with the outdoors. This app aims to aid the population, and visitors of Toronto, to overcome this issue. Through the use of different app pages users may explore ways to explore the outdoors, and also help in sustainable practices.
