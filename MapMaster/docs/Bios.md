## Team MapMaster Bios

***Amaka Onyeze:***
I am a fourth-year undergrad student at McMaster pursuing an Honours Bachelors in Environment and Society program and concurrent certificates in GIS and Urban studies and planning. My independent study focused on assessing the density of electric vehicle infrastructure in Ontario. Outside of academics, I enjoy crocheting, resin art and reading.

***Audreana Rossi:***
I am currently enrolled in McMaster Universityâ€™s Honours of Environmental Science program and am working toward my concurrent certificate in GIS. After I graduate in April, I plan to pursue my education in GIS at NSCC - COGS in September. Currently, I am using ArcGIS Pro and the arcbinding() package in R for my independent study research. This research involves building an R-Script tool to perform a geospatial analysis of impaired and distracted driving in Toronto, Ontario. Outside of academics, I enjoy running, hanging out with my dog and attending any and all concerts. 

***Eva Novoselac:***
I am a fourth-year student at McMaster University in the Honours Environmental Sciences program also pursuing a concurrent certificate in GIS. I am working on an independent study project combining my interests in GIS and conservation through exploring habitat suitability for Species at Risk with multicriteria decision analysis in ArcGIS Pro. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, reading, and spending time with my cats.
