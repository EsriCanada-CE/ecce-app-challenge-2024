    App: Urban Expansion and Wildfires in BC
    
    **Team Mission Statement**
    
    Our team is dedicated to the creation of innovative solutions that utilize ESRI technology to address pressing urban and environmental challenges. Through our app, our aim is to provide good insight into a couple things between a 2010 to 2020 time range in British Columbia; The changing human footprint index (HFI), especially around urban centers, and wildfires that are increasing over the years that pose a risk to urban centers. By visualizing urban growth and wildfires, our app aims to empower users with information to make informed decisions regarding urban development, land use planning, and wildfire risk mitigation strategies.
    
    **Statement of the characteristics of the app that make it appealing,**
    
    **interesting, and useful (i.e., how does it help the end user)**
    
    The following points summarize the characteristics that make our app appealing, interesting, and useful.
    
    1. Data Visualization: Our app utilizes interactive maps, charts, and graphs to visualize changes in the HFI and wildfire occurrences over roughly the past decade based on gathered data. This makes complex data easy to understand and analyze for users interested in these variables for the province of BC.
    2. Temporal Insights: By focusing on data from 2010 to 2020, our app provides relevant information on urban growth patterns and wildfire trends in BC. This enables stakeholders to stay informed about current environmental changes and the potential risks to urban areas.
    3. User-Friendly Interface: We prioritize usability and accessibility, ensuring our app is intuitive and has ease-of-use for the users with varying levels of technical expertise. This allows for a wider range of users to easily engage and enjoy using our app.
    
    Overall, our app combines great ESRI technology with actionable insights to address the complex interplay of growing HFI and urbanization with wildfire hazards. By empowering users with information and tools to understand and mitigate these risks, we strive to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future for urban environments.
