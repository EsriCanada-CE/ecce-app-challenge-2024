## Introduction

The 2024 Esri Canada GIS Centers of Excellence App Challenge introduces a compelling theme focusing on Urban Expansion, highlighting the significant implications of urbanization on both human societies and the natural environment. This theme has been carefully selected to shed light on the challenges and opportunities arising from the rapid growth and transformation of urban areas. As cities continue to evolve, it becomes imperative to address various issues such as housing affordability, infrastructure development, green space preservation, and sustainable transportation systems.
In response to this theme, our team, the Team Dinos, presents the "Calgary’s Urban Expansion Insight" app. This innovative application aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Calgary's urban expansion dynamics, leveraging open spatial data and crowd-sourced information. By analyzing data from community census profiles in 2016 and 2019, our app offers valuable insights into key indicators of urban growth, including population trends, residential development patterns, and changes in dwelling values.

## Mission Statement
Team Dinos is dedicated to exploring and analyzing Calgary's urban evolution with a focus on sustainability and community well-being. Our mission is to uncover insights into urban expansion dynamics, empower informed decision-making, and foster a more resilient and inclusive future for our city. Through innovative use of spatial data and technology, we aim to illuminate the challenges and opportunities posed by urban growth, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of Calgary's livability and vibrancy.

## Features and Usage

The "Calgary’s Urban Expansion Insight" app, built with ArcGIS Experience Builder, explores Calgary's urban growth using key indicators like population, residential building permits, and dwelling values. Here's how our app stands out:

Identifying Clusters: Our hot spot tool helps users pinpoint areas with significant population growth and heightened housing demand, offering insights into urban development hotspots.

(3) Directional Distribution:
Spatial Insights: By generating standard deviational ellipses or ellipsoids, our app summarizes dwelling spatial characteristics, including central tendency, dispersion, and directional trends. This illuminates dwelling distribution patterns across Calgary.
(4) Interactive Visualization:
Engaging Maps: Our interactive map interface provides users with an immersive experience to explore and analyze urban expansion data effortlessly.
Enhanced Graphs: We present data in visually compelling graphical charts, enriching the interpretation of urban growth indicators.
Insightful Tables: Detailed tabular data allows for in-depth analysis and deeper understanding of urban expansion trends.

With these powerful features, the "Calgary’s Urban Expansion Insight" app empowers users to gain invaluable insights into Calgary's urban landscape, enabling informed decision-making for urban planning initiatives, policymaking, and research endeavors.


## Data sources 

The app "Calgary’s Urban Expansion Insight" relies on open data sources, Census by Community for the years 2016, 2017, and 2019, sourced from Calgary’s Open Data Portal. These datasets offer official counts of dwelling units and population within each community district in Calgary. They provide essential information for understanding demographic trends, housing patterns, and population characteristics across different areas of the city. By leveraging this data, the app facilitates in-depth analysis and informed decision-making in urban planning initiatives.
