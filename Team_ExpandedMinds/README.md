## Mission Statement
Canada is becoming increasingly urbanized. With most Canadians living in urban centers, and new arrivals to the country flocking to cities, understanding how cityscapes have evolved to support such growth is crucial. 

Halifax is currently one of Canada’s fastest growing urban centers, which allows for its urban expansion to be examined as it is emblematic of larger changes seen across Canada (Statistics Canada, 2022). Over the past three centuries Halifax has experienced massive transformation from its birth as a colonial military outpost, and emerging over periods of industrialization and suburbanization into the city as we know it today. Our mission is to showcase urban expansion through the lens of urban historical geography, where Halifax can be used as a case study to highlight the processes that have transformed Canadian cities. In doing so we will explore the colonial, industrial, and modern evolutions of the city, and gain a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding urban expansion that planners face as they design cities of the present and future. 

## App Description
Our app, Halifax Emerging, utilizes Esri’s ArcGIS Experience Builder to bring to life the evolution of Halifax, allowing users to better understand how this urban space has transformed and expanded through archival photographs, interactive maps, and additional linked resources (such as documentaries and websites). We chose Experience Builder because it is accessible through different devices – including computers and mobile phones – and because it allowed us to incorporate a wide variety of media and data to tell the city’s history. Users can scroll through Halifax Emerging at their own pace, revisiting resources we have linked and the maps we have created.

Our maps were made using open spatial data made available by the Government of Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and the Halifax Regional Municipality. They showcase characteristics of Halifax’s population, infrastructure, land use, and urban expansion over time.
