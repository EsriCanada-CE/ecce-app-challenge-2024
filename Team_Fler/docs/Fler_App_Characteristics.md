# The MetroPulse BC App:

- Employs an intuitive and friendly interface design, suitable for users ranging from the general public to more specialized professionals (i.e. GIS, policy, and planning).

- Recontextualizes data sets within the metric of percentage change in population density between 2016 and 2021.

- Reconciles varied data sets to the census metropolitan and census agglomeration geographic level for cross-comparison purposes.

- Presents novel / difficult-to-access data (e.g. Social Vulnerability, from the National Human Settlement Layer) alongside metrics from Statistics Canada and the BC Data Catalogue.

- Using structure and storytelling, guides the user through multiple geographic levels: from national to provincial to city, concluding with the local / personal (in the form of a survey).

- Gives users the ability to simply "click and compare" for quick generation of GIS insights about the regions of BC of greatest interest to them.

- Gives users the opportunity to share their experiences about how urban densification has impacted their lives.

- Collects quantitative data such as user demographics alongside qualitative data such as opinions about urban expansion.

- Uses unique visual styling to engage the user and differentiate from templated ArcGIS applications, while leveraging the unique capabilities of ArcGIS Experience Builder to implement low-code solutions for dynamic data display (e.g. Arcade expressions, dynamically linked data sources, and map / widget "Message Actions").
