## The Urban GIStressors Mission Statement:
Our team, the Urban GIStressors, aimed to create an app that provides information on the population density of London, Ontario in an accessible format. London is a growing city, impacted by ongoing urbanization. As such, the population has seen drastic changes between 2016 and 2021. We wanted to create a visual for this change, so that individuals such as urban planners, developers, and those looking to move to the city, can note areas of significant shift and growth in population. While looking at population density numbers alone can show obvious increases but a visual, such as our map app, is essential to spatial understanding of the cityâ€™s growth both as a whole and by neighborhood! 

## Characteristics of the App:
Our Dashboard app, on the population density of London features multiple panels that are interactive for users to explore the data! 

We begin with a panel on the top left to explore the neighbourhoods of London. This allows users to highlight various regions within the City of London and explore the population data and density associated with them. This feature is useful when looking at neighbourhoods as a whole to compare densities or focus on specific regions of interest. Below this is some background information on the City of London. Here, we share the rich history of the city for users to contextually place themselves within our app. On the top right, we share important statistics about the number of areas and population density across time in the city. In large and bold font, these numbers jump out to users as important and inform them of what they are comparing on the map itself. In our bottom right corner, users are taught how to use the app; they may simply select their layer (2016 or 2021) and examine the neighborhood classification on the choropleth map. The central map acts as the focal point of the app, where population density data is displayed for users to interact with in terms of the aforementioned features. 

Our app purposefully simplifies population density data across time to provide an accessible and educational format for individuals to seek information in a visual manner.

## How to use it
The app is very straightforward. User can view the overall population density pattern through the map in the centre of the application. The patterns from 2016 and 2021 can be selected toggled on and off with the layer visibility tool at the top right of the map. To inspect a specific neighbourhood in London, Ontario, users can use the selector tool on the left side of the application, "Select London Neighbourhood", to filter out the desired neighbourhood(s). The map will pan and zoom to the selected neighbourhood for more detailed visualization.
