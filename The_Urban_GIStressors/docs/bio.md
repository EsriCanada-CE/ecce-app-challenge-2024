**Eunice Chu**: Hi, my name is Eunice and I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student studying geographic information science. I have been using GIS during my studies, and my research interest lies in transportation and healthcare accessibility. I hope to pursue my career in the GIS industry and potentially continue my studies in the future. 

**Samantha Sharp**: Hi, my name is Samantha! I am a second-year student at the University of Western Ontario in Geography and Environment and English. I actively use my GIS skills and Esri products to support women's rights and their confluence with climate change studies. I hope to continue to develop my abilities in the next two years of my undergraduate degree!

**Rachael Skikos**: Hi, my name is Rachael and I’m in my final year of a Specialization in Environmental Science and a Certification in GIS. I’ve spent the last two summers working in reptile conservation in southwestern Ontario and hope to continue doing so after graduating this year.
